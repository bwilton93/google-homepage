# google-homepage

This project is an attempt to make a clone of the google homepage.

I will demonstrate knowledge in HTML and CSS during this project.

Check out the finished project on https://bwilton93.github.io/google-homepage/

Most of the page functions as expected, the search box even takes you to a google results page (the actual one). Things that required JavaScript don't function as I have not learnt this yet.
